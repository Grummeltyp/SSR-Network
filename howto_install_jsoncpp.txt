This is a step-by-step instruction to install the JsonCpp library on Linux and
Mac Os X:

1. Download JsonCpp from http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
2. Unpack the tarball in a directory of your choice
3. Follow the Building instructions in JsonCpps README. After doing so, there
   should be the directories "include" and "libs" in the JsonCpp directory.
4. You have to install the library to your system manually. In order to so, copy
   the contents of include to /opt/local/include

    cp -R include/json /opt/local/include

   Additionally, copy the static and dynamic libraries to /opt/local/libs and
   rename them accordingly:

    cp libs/YOURLIBRARYDIR/YOURLIBRARYNAME.a /opt/local/libs/libjsoncpp.a
    cp libs/YOURLIBRARYDIR/YOURLIBRARYNAME.dylib /opt/local/libs/libjsoncpp.dylib

That's it, now you're set to use JsonCpp.
